**MATH 415: Applied Linear Algebra**  
I was a teching assistant for applied linear algebra at [UIUC's netmath program](https://netmath.illinois.edu/). This program was designed to offer students the flexibility to take math courses online and receive credits for their completion. As a Teacher's Assistant for [MATH 415: applied linear algebra](https://math.illinois.edu/resources/syllabus-math-415), I spent time grading the course work of students while hosting office hours for students to ask questions and better understand course content.
