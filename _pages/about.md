I'm a Senior Software Engineer at theÂ [Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/occ.asp). As a member of the data platform team, my work focuses on the development of data workflows to ingest high volumes of data from multiple sources and the organization of this data into usable formats for downstream analytics teams to use. I specialize in the creation of end-to-end big data solutions and its usage in further analytical processing.

I graduated from the University of [Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) with a [B.S. in Material Science and Engineering](https://matse.illinois.edu/) and acquired [UIUC's certificate in data science](https://stat.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/minors/certificate-data-science). Alongside my studies, I worked as a part-time Machine Learning Engineer at a start-up company from my school's incubator named EarthSense, Inc. This is where I acquired many foundational skills in working with large volumes of data to train deep learning computer vision models for plant trait detection. Upon graduation, I worked at [Maven Wave Partners](https://eviden.com/about-us/legacy-brands/maven-wave/) as a data engineer consultant creating cloud native data solutions for clients. The breath of work here allowed me to increase my technology tool belt while learning the different contexts of data engineering. As such, I am passionate about architecting and implementing data solutions primarily in the context of finance.
